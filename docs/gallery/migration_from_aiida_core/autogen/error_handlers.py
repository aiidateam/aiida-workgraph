Error Handling in WorkGraph
===========================

This tutorial demonstrates how to implement robust error handling in an AiiDA WorkGraph.
We will compare the traditional approach using `BaseRestartWorkChain` with the more
flexible error handling mechanism available in `aiida-workgraph`.
"""
# %%
# Introduction: Error Handling in AiiDA
# =====================================
# AiiDA provides a ``BaseRestartWorkChain`` class to create workflows that can
# automatically recover from known failure modes of calculations. This is
# typically done by defining specific handlers for error codes produced by a
# particular ``Process`` class.
#
# While powerful, this approach ties the error handling logic to a specific
# WorkChain implementation. In contrast, `aiida-workgraph` offers a more general
# mechanism where error handlers can be defined as independent functions and
# attached to any task within a WorkGraph.
#
# First, let's look at a `BaseRestartWorkChain` example.

# Error Handling in a WorkGraph
# =============================
# Now, let's implement the same logic using a WorkGraph. The process involves
# three main steps:
#
# 1.  **Define an error handler function**: This function takes a `Task` object
#     as input and contains the logic to resolve the error.
# 2.  **Build a WorkGraph**: Create a WorkGraph and add the task that might fail.
# 3.  **Register the error handler**: Attach the handler function to the specific
#     task, specifying which exit codes should trigger it.

    Error handler for ArithmeticAddCalculation.

    This function is triggered when the calculation fails with exit code 410
    (ERROR_NEGATIVE_NUMBER). It modifies the task's inputs by taking the
    absolute value of `x` and `y`, allowing the task to be restarted.

    :param task: The Task object that failed.
    :return: A message indicating that the handler was executed.
    """
    from aiida.orm import Int

    return msg


# %%
# Building and Running the WorkGraph
# ==================================
# We create a WorkGraph, add the `ArithmeticAddCalculation` as a task, and then
# register our `handle_negative_sum` function as its error handler.

# 1. Create a new WorkGraph
wg = WorkGraph("error_handling_graph")

# 2. Add the calculation task
task1 = wg.add_task(ArithmeticAddCalculation, name="add_task")

# 3. Register the error handler for the task
task1.add_error_handler(
    {
        "handle_negative_sum": {
            "executor": handle_negative_sum,
            "exit_codes": [
                ArithmeticAddCalculation.exit_codes.ERROR_NEGATIVE_NUMBER.status
            ],
            "max_retries": 3,
        }
    }
)

# ------------------------- Submit the calculation -------------------
from aiida import load_profile
from aiida.orm import Int, load_code

load_profile()

# Define the inputs that will cause the calculation to fail initially.
inputs = {
    "add_task": {
        "code": load_code("add@localhost"),
        "x": Int(1),
        "y": Int(-6),  # This will result in a negative sum, triggering the error.
    },
}

# Submit the WorkGraph and wait for it to complete.
# The error handler will be executed automatically by the engine.
print("Submitting WorkGraph that is expected to fail and be corrected...")
wg.run(inputs=inputs)


# %%
# Verifying the Result
# ====================
# After the WorkGraph finishes, we can inspect the final state of the task
# to confirm that the error was handled and the calculation eventually
# succeeded.

add_task = wg.tasks["add_task"]
print(f"Task finished OK? {add_task.process.is_finished_ok}")
print(f"Final exit status: {add_task.process.exit_status}")
print(f"Final result: {add_task.outputs['sum'].value}")

# We can also visualize the process call graph to see the failure and restart.
# The graph will show the first `ArithmeticAddCalculation` failing (exit code 410)
# and a second, corrected one finishing successfully (exit code 0).
print("\n--- Process Call Graph ---")
print(format_call_graph(wg.process))


# %%
# Conclusion
# ==========
# The `aiida-workgraph` error handling mechanism provides a powerful and
# decoupled way to manage failures. By separating the error handling logic
# from the workflow definition, you can create reusable handlers that can be
# applied to different tasks across various WorkGraphs, leading to more
# modular and maintainable scientific workflows.
#
