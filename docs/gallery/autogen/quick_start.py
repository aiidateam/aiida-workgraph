"""

# %%
# Introduction
# ------------
#
# In this quick-start tutorial, we will cover:
#
# - the basics of ``WorkGraph`` with a simple arithmetic workflow
# - how to define and use
#
#   - tasks to encapsulate a process
#   - sub-workflows as tasks to encapsulate several sub-processes
#
# - an advanced example demonstrating control flow in ``WorkGraph``

# %%
# Installation
# ------------
#
# Let's first install ``aiida-workgraph``
#
# .. code:: console
#
#    $ pip install aiida-workgraph
#
# This will also install ``aiida-core`` and its dependencies.

# %%
# Setup
# -----
#
# To interact with the AiiDA database, you need to load your AiiDA profile.
# If you haven't configured one yet, you can do so by running the following command:
#
# .. code:: console
#
#    $ verdi presto
#
# To load your profile, add the following code to your script or Jupyter notebook:

# sphinx_gallery_start_ignore
from aiida_workgraph.utils.logging import set_aiida_loglevel

set_aiida_loglevel("REPORT")
# sphinx_gallery_end_ignore

from aiida import load_profile

load_profile()

# %%
# .. note::
#
#    AiiDA also provides a pre-configured (pre-loaded profile) shell.
#    You can launch it with:
#
#    .. code:: console
#
#       $ verdi shell
#
# .. note::
#
#    You can find out more about AiiDA and its architecture in the `AiiDA documentation`_.
#
# .. tip::
#
#    Some features of ``WorkGraph`` are best demonstrated interactively.
#    We recommend using the AiiDA GUI for this.
#    You can learn how to run and use the GUI in the :doc:`../gui/web` section.

# %%
# Simple workflow
# ---------------
#
# Suppose you want to compute ``(x + y) * z`` and record both operations.
# The simplest way to do this in ``WorkGraph`` is as follows:

from aiida_workgraph import WorkGraph

with WorkGraph("AddMultiply") as wg:
    wg.inputs = ("x", "y", "z")
    wg.outputs.result = (wg.inputs.x + wg.inputs.y) * wg.inputs.z

# %%
# We've defined our first workflow using ``WorkGraph`` ðŸŽ‰
#
# The workflow expects three arguments, ``x``, ``y``, and ``z``.
# It sets up as tasks the addition of the ``x`` and ``y`` (in parentheses), and the multiplication of the result by ``z``.
# Finally, it assigns the final result as an output.
#
# .. tip::
#
#    ``result`` is a special output port given by default.
#    However, you can also define your own output ports with ``wg.outputs.my_output = ...``.
#    You can learn more about graph-level inputs and output in the :doc:`../howto/autogen/graph_level` how-to section.
#
# We can visualize the workgraph to inspect the tasks and their connections.

wg.to_html()

# %%
# Let's run it with some inputs:

wg.run(inputs={"x": 2, "y": 3, "z": 4})

# %%
# .. tip::
#
#    If you've configure a message broker in AiiDA, you can also submit the workgraph
#    (queue it for execution) with
#
#    .. code:: python
#
#       wg.submit(inputs=..., wait=True)
#
#    You can use ``wait=True`` to block the terminal or notebook until the workflow finishes.
#    You can learn more about this in the `AiiDA documentation`_.


# %%
# Let's have a look at the result:

print("Result:", wg.outputs.result.value)

# %%
# We can also access the results of the individual tasks:

print("Result of addition:", wg.tasks.op_add.outputs.result.value)
print("Result of multiplication:", wg.tasks.op_mul.outputs.result.value)

# %%
# .. note::
#
#    Many Python operators are supported in ``WorkGraph`` and are automatically converted to tasks with the name ``op_<operator>``, e.g. ``op_add``, ``op_mul``, ``op_lt``, ``op_eq``, and more.

# %%
# .. tip::
#
#    If you're running the AiiDA GUI, you can visualize the executed workflow interactively.
#    Click on the ``PK`` field of the submitted workflow (look for *WorkGraph<AddMultiply>*) to view its details.
#
# So far so good! We have a simple workflow, can visualize it, run/submit it with inputs, and inspect its outputs.
# However, in practice, tasks will require operations more complex than simple arithmetics.
# How can we handle these?

# %%
# Defining a ``Task``
# -------------------
#
# A ``Task`` is the basic building block of the ``WorkGraph``. It has inputs,
# outputs, and an executor. Let's define the above operations as tasks.

from aiida_workgraph import task


@task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y


@task
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y


# %%
# We can use these functional tasks directly in a workgraph as follows:

with WorkGraph("AddMultiplyWithDefinedTasks") as wg:
    wg.inputs = dict.fromkeys(["x", "y", "z"])
    add_outputs = add(x=wg.inputs.x, y=wg.inputs.y)
    mul_outputs = multiply(x=add_outputs.result, y=wg.inputs.z)
    wg.outputs.result = mul_outputs.result

wg.to_html()

# %%
# Compare the graph above with the one we defined earlier.
# Other than the task names, they are identical, as to be expected.
#
# Functional tasks are used just as they do in Python.
# The main difference is that instead of values, we pass inputs by reference.
# This creates a link, or dependency, between input/output sockets.
# Moreover, unlike the case of ``wg.inputs.x + wg.inputs.y``, calling a ``Task`` returns an outputs (sockets) namespace.
# This is because in general, a task can have multiple outputs.
# For example, let's compare calling ``add``:

add(x=2, y=3)

# %%
# with calling the following:


@task(outputs=["count", "even_numbers"])
def count_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
    return len(even_numbers), even_numbers


count_even_numbers(numbers=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# %%
# We can see that without explicitly specifying the expected outputs of a task, we get the default ``result`` socket.
#
# .. note::
#
#    When we do specify our outputs, they become available at ``<task_name>.outputs.<output_name>`` post-execution.
#
# Great! We can now define functional tasks to cover any Python logic we can think of.
# Let's now consider higher-order workflows, i.e. ones that reuse other workflows as tasks.

# %%
# ``WorkGraph`` as a ``Task``
# ---------------------------
#
# We can expose a ``WorkGraph`` as a ``Task`` by using the ``@task.graph`` decorator.
# This is useful for task encapsulation and reusability, as well as for defining dynamic (runtime-input-dependent) workflows.
# Let's see how this works in practice.


@task
def random_number_generator(minimum, maximum):
    import random

    return random.randint(minimum, maximum)


@task
def generate_numbers(n):
    return [*range(n)]


@task
def sum_numbers(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)


@task.graph
def SumEvenNumbers(numbers):
    even_numbers_output = count_even_numbers(numbers=numbers)
    return sum_numbers(numbers=even_numbers_output.even_numbers).result


with WorkGraph("SumEvenRandomNumbers") as wg:
    wg.inputs = dict.fromkeys(["minimum", "maximum"])
    n = random_number_generator(wg.inputs.minimum, wg.inputs.maximum).result
    numbers = generate_numbers(n=n).result
    wg.outputs = SumEvenNumbers(numbers=numbers).result

wg.to_html()

# %%
# .. note::
#
#    Though not strictly required, we name our graph tasks using camel case to distinguish them from regular tasks.
#    If not explicitly overridden, the name of the decorated function will be used as the name of the task when inspecting processes using, for example, ``verdi process list``.
#
# Here we see *SumEvenNumbers* as a black-box task.
# To inspect its internal tasks, we can use the ``build_graph`` method as follows:

SumEvenNumbers.build_graph(numbers=[*range(42)]).to_html()

# %%
# .. tip::
#
#    When using the AiiDA GUI to inspect executed workflows, sub-workflows can be expanded interactively to inspect their internal tasks and connections.

# %%
# .. tip::
#
#    To learn more about workflow composition, see the :doc:`../howto/autogen/combine_workgraphs` how-to section.

# %%
# Dynamic workflow
# ----------------
#
# So far, our workflows have been simple and linear.
# However, often we need to create more complex workflows that involve branching, loops, and other control structures.
# Let's explore such a scenario.
# Suppose we want to conditionally sum a set of numbers based on some random input.
# If the input is greather than 50, we filter out the even numbers and sum them.
# Otherwise, we just sum all the numbers.
# Let's try to define this workflow using what we've learned so far:
#
# .. code:: python
#
#    with WorkGraph("ComplexWorkflow") as wg:
#        wg.inputs = dict.fromkeys(["minimum", "maximum"])
#        n = random_number_generator(wg.inputs.minimum, wg.inputs.maximum).result
#        numbers = generate_numbers(n=n).result
#        if n < 50:
#            the_sum = sum_numbers(numbers=numbers).result
#        else:
#            the_sum = SumEvenNumbers(numbers=numbers).result
#        wg.outputs.sum = the_sum

# %%
# This seems straightforward.
# However, **it won't work as expected**.
# The reason is that the ``if`` statement requires the value of ``n``, which is not available at the time of the workflow definition.
#
# To handle this conditional logic, and any other flow control for that matter, we must queue it as a graph task.
# Another way to think of it is that any Pythonic control flow statement must be deferred to runtime.
# For this, **we need task encapsulation**.
#
# Let's do this now for the above example:


@task.graph
def ConditionalSum(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 50:
        return sum_numbers(numbers=numbers).result
    return SumEvenNumbers(numbers=numbers).result


with WorkGraph("ComplexWorkflow") as wg:
    wg.inputs = dict.fromkeys(["minimum", "maximum"])
    n = random_number_generator(wg.inputs.minimum, wg.inputs.maximum).result
    numbers = generate_numbers(n=n).result
    wg.outputs.sum = ConditionalSum(numbers=numbers).result

wg.to_html()

# %%
#
# By treating the conditional logic as a task, there is no need to know the value of ``n`` at workflow definition time, as the conditional statement will only evaluate when the workflow is executed.
# This allows us to define dynamic workflows that **decide their flow at runtime**.
#
# To see this more clearly, we can inspect the graph of the ``ConditionalSum`` task given inputs on both ends of the condition:

ConditionalSum.build_graph(numbers=[*range(40)]).to_html("html/ConditionalSumTrue.html")

# %%
ConditionalSum.build_graph(numbers=[*range(60)]).to_html(
    "html/ConditionalSumFalse.html"
)

# %%
# You can learn more about ``WorkGraph`` flow control in the :doc:`../howto/autogen/control-flow` how-to section.
# You can also learn more about the ``@task.graph`` decorator in the :doc:`../concept/autogen/graph_builder_concept` concept section.
