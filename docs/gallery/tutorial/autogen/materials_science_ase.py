=====================================================
Computational materials science with ASE
=====================================================

Introduction
============
We'll explore two key examples that highlight the flexibility of AiiDA-WorkGraph:

1.  **Atomization energy**: A simple, linear workflow to calculate the atomization energy of a diatomic molecule.
2.  **Equation of state (EOS)**: A more advanced workflow for bulk structure that showcases how to handle ``if`` condition, parallel execution, and dynamic inputs/outputs, a common pattern in dynamic workflows.

"""

# %%
# First, ensure you have `aiida-workgraph` and `ase` installed, and have configured an AiiDA environment.
# If not, you can install the necessary packages:
#
# .. code-block:: console
#
#    pip install aiida-workgraph ase
#
# Then, load your AiiDA profile.

from aiida import load_profile

load_profile()

# %%
# .. _ase_atomization_energy:
# Atomization energy of a diatomic molecule
# ==========================================
# The atomization energy (:math:`\Delta E`) is the energy required to break a molecule down into its individual, separate atoms.
# For a diatomic molecule, the formula is straightforward:
#
# .. math::
#
#    \Delta E = 2 \times E_{\text{atom}} - E_{\text{molecule}}
#
# Where :math:`E_{\text{atom}}` is the total energy of a single atom and :math:`E_{\text{molecule}}` is the total energy of the molecule.
#
# To build our workflow, we'll start with standard Python functions and convert them into AiiDA-trackable components using the ``@task`` decorator.
#
# .. note::
#
#    We're using the ASE EMT (Effective Medium Theory) calculator because it's exceptionally fast and perfect for demonstrations.
#    You can easily swap it with any other ASE-compatible calculator, like Quantum ESPRESSO, VASP, or GPAW, for your research.
#    For realistic simulations, especially with DFT codes, you would typically run these calculations on a remote computer.
#    For more details on running calculations remotely, please refer to the section on :ref:`Run calculations remotely <remote_calculations>`.

# .. _ase_eos:
# Equation of state
# ==================
# Now for a more complex and practical example: calculating the Equation of State (EOS) for a bulk material.
# The process involves several steps:
#
# 1.  **Relax**(optional) the initial atomic structure to its lowest-energy state.
# 2.  **Strain** the relaxed structure by applying a series of scaling factors.
# 3.  **Calculate** the total energy and volume for each strained structure.
# 4.  **Fit** the resulting energy-volume data to an EOS model to find properties like the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus.
#
# This workflow perfectly demonstrates how to handle loops and a dynamic number of calculations.

# Conclusion
# ==========
# Congratulations! You've now seen the core principles of `AiiDA-WorkGraph` in action.
# You have learned how to:
#
# -   Transform any Python function into a robust, provenance-tracked task with the ``@task`` decorator.
# -   Compose tasks into complete workflows using ``@task.graph``, from simple linear chains to complex graphs.
# -   Manage advanced patterns like ``if`` condition, parallel execution, and **dynamic namespaces**.
# -   Build, execute, and visualize both the workflow plan and its final, rich **provenance graph**.
#
# These powerful concepts are the foundation for building sophisticated, automated, and fully reproducible simulation pipelines for your own research projects. Happy computing! ðŸš€
