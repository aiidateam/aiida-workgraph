        "# Streamline Your Research: Integrate Your Favorite Tools with AiiDA-WorkGraph\n",
        "\n",
        "AiiDA is sometimes viewed as having a steep initial setup, primarily because users are required to develop AiiDA plugins to execute their codes on remote computers. This development process involves creating input generators, output parsers, and configuring codes for execution. Software packages such as ASE, which already include APIs to manage these tasks, are widely utilized within various communities and boast many impressive features. Requiring developers to adapt their packages to meet AiiDA-specific requirements introduces significant overhead, including the need to maintain dual codebases. Moreover, AiiDA's emphasis on data provenance demands that data be transformed to fit its unique database format, a process divergent from those used by other packages.\n",
        "\n",
        "The new `PythonJob` built-in task in AiiDA-WorkGraph innovates by allowing users to deploy their existing package APIs to operate jobs on remote computers seamlessly. For example, users can now directly use ASE’s calculator to perform DFT calculations remotely by writing standard Python functions. The WorkGraph manages the execution of these functions on remote computers, handles checkpoints, manages data transformations, and ensures comprehensive data provenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Highlighted Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Leveraging Existing Packages**: Utilize existing packages like ASE, which are equipped with APIs for managing inputs, execution, and outputs, directly. This integration significantly reduces redundancy in the traditional AiiDA setup processes, increasing user efficiency.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Broad Accessibility**: The `PythonJob` task aims to make AiiDA more accessible by enabling users from various backgrounds to integrate their existing tools without converting them into AiiDA-specific formats. This enhancement broadens AiiDA’s appeal across diverse scientific and engineering communities.\n",
