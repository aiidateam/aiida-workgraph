    "Suppose you have a workflow that needs to launch multiple subprocesses (e.g., 100 calcjobs), but your computer has resource limitations that only allow running 5 calcjobs concurrently. Additionally, you don't have access to a job management system like SLURM locally. In such cases, you can set up a simple job queue management system using AiiDA's WorkGraph by limiting the maximum number of subprocesses running simultaneously within the WorkGraph. \n",
