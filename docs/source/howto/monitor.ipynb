    "# Assign a monitoring task\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `monitor` decorator is designed for tasks that need to poll a specific state at regular intervals until a success criterion is met. This is useful for various scenarios, including time-based triggers, file existence checks, and monitoring other tasks or workgraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time-based events**: Start a task at a specified time.\n",
    "- **File-based events**: Execute a task when a particular file exists.\n",
    "- **Monitor a task**: Observe the state of another task and act based on certain conditions.\n",
    "- **Cross-workGraph dependencies**: Check the state of a task in a different workgraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "While polling, the task sleeps for a specified interval (default 1.0 second), allowing the workgraph engine to manage other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The monitor task has two built-in parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `interval`: The time interval between each poll.\n",
    "- `timeout`: The maximum time to wait for the success criterion to be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will walk through examples of how to use the `monitor` task decorator for these scenarios.\n"

You also learned how to kill a monitor task and about the built-in monitor tasks provided by `WorkGraph`. Finally, you explored the `awaitable` decorator for integrating asynchronous functions within tasks. These enhancements provide powerful tools for managing dependencies and asynchronous operations within `WorkGraph`, offering greater flexibility and efficiency in task execution."
