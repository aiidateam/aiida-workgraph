    "## Monitor Task Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `monitor` decorator is designed for tasks that need to poll a specific state at regular intervals until a success criterion is met. This is useful for various scenarios, including time-based triggers, file existence checks, and monitoring other tasks or WorkGraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Trigger**: Start a task at a specified time.\n",
    "- **File Trigger**: Execute a task when a particular file exists.\n",
    "- **Task Monitor**: Observe the state of another task and act based on certain conditions.\n",
    "- **Cross-WorkGraph Dependencies**: Check the state of a task in a different WorkGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "While polling, the task sleeps for a specified interval (default 1.0 second, customizable by the user), allowing the WorkGraph engine to manage other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The monitor task has two built-in parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `interval`: The time interval between each poll.\n",
    "- `timeout`: The maximum time to wait for the success criterion to be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "A task waits until a specified time.\n",
    "\n"

    "\n",
    "These enhancements provide powerful tools for managing dependencies and asynchronous operations within WorkGraph, offering greater flexibility and efficiency in task execution."
