    "## Why an “imperative” API?\n",
    "\n",
    "The default WorkGraph engines ask you to **declare** every task and dependency *before* execution.\n",
    "The *imperative* engine in **aiida‑workgraph** lets you write an ordinary Python `async` function instead.  Each time you call a task inside that function the engine immediately schedules it and updates the WorkGraph on‑the‑fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Benefits*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Natural control‑flow** – use native `while`, `for`, `if/else`, exceptions.\n",
    "* **Incremental graphs** – dependencies are inferred automatically.\n",
    "* **Rapid prototyping** – no context variables or DSL constructs required.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need full static inspection before running, the declarative API is still available; you can even mix both styles in one project.\n",
