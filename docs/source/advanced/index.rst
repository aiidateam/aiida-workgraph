The following sections provide details on the two additional modes of use of AiiDA WorkGraph:

* :doc:`/advanced/autogen/node_graph_programming`
   This section covers node-graph programming, allowing users to build workflows by connecting task inputs and outputs, enabling easy modification and extension.

* :doc:`/advanced/autogen/context_manager`
   This section discusses the context manager paradigm, which offers explicit zones like `If`, `While`, and `Map` to build a graph that clearly shows the workflow's structure and dependencies.
