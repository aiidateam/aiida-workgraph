The following sections provide details on advanced use of AiiDA WorkGraph:

* :doc:`/advanced/autogen/context`
   This section introduces the use of the AiiDA context, which allows users to store and retrieve data within the workflow's execution context, facilitating data management and sharing between tasks.

* :doc:`/advanced/autogen/context_manager`
   This section discusses the context manager paradigm, which offers explicit zones like ``If``, ``While``, and ``Map`` to build a graph that clearly shows the workflow's structure and dependencies.

* :doc:`/advanced/autogen/node_graph_programming`
   This section covers node-graph programming, allowing users to build workflows by connecting task inputs and outputs, enabling easy modification and extension.
