Installation
============


The recommended method of installation is to use the Python package manager |pip|_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install aiida-workgraph[widget]

This will install the latest stable version that was released to PyPI.

To install the package from source, first clone the repository and then install using |pip|_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-workgraph
    $ cd aiida-workgraph
    $ pip install -e .

The ``-e`` flag will install the package in editable mode, meaning that changes to the source code will be automatically picked up.
To install the jupyter widget support you need to in addition build the JavaScript packages:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install .[widget]
    $ cd aiida-workgraph
    $ pip install -e .
    $ # build widget
    $ cd aiida_workgraph/widget/
    $ npm install
    $ npm run build
    $ # build web frontend
    $ cd ../../aiida_workgraph/web/frontend/
    $ npm install
    $ npm run build


.. |pip| replace:: ``pip``
