    "### How do I convert a workchain into a WorkGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "We provided an example to demonstrate how to transition from a WorkChain to a WorkGraph. The example is available [here](https://aiida-workgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/transfer_workchain.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Whether to include WorkGraph in the aiida-plugin?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Including WorkGraph allows users to combine and modify components flexibly.\n",
    "2. Excluding WorkGraph would mean users treat the WorkChain more like a 'black box'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If WorkGraph includes checkpoint similar to WorkChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, WorkGraph supports checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When a WorkGraph is finished, can I read the result of a `Normal` task?\n",
    "No. When a WorkGraph is finished, it only only read the data which is saved in the AiiDA proprovenance. A `Normal` task is designed as a intermidate step, and not generating new data."
