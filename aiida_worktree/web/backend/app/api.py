# Integrating React build into a FastAPI application and serving the build (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) as static files
# TODO for the moment, one can not refresh the page, because the backend does not know the routes
"""
When you navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/settings from http://127.0.0.1:8000/ using client-side
routing (i.e., links within your React app), the React Router handles the route /settings
without reloading the page from the server. This is why it works.
However, when you refresh the page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/settings, the browser makes
a request to the FastAPI server for /settings. Since this route isn't defined in FastAPI
(it's a client-side route), the server returns a 404 Not Found error.
