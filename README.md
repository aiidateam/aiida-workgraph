Efficiently design and manage flexible workflows with AiiDA, featuring an interactive GUI, checkpoints, provenance tracking, error-resistant, and remote execution capabilities.



## Installation

```console
    pip install aiida-workgraph[widget]
```

To install the latest version from source, first clone the repository and then install using `pip`:

```console
git clone https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-workgraph
cd aiida-workgraph
pip install -e .
```

To install the jupyter widget support you need to in addition build the JavaScript packages:

```console
pip install .[widget]
# build widget
cd aiida_workgraph/widget/
npm install
npm run build
# build web frontend
cd ../../aiida_workgraph/web/frontend/
npm install
npm run build
```

## Documentation
Explore the comprehensive [documentation](https://aiida-workgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to discover all the features and capabilities of AiiDA Workgraph.

## Demo
Visit the [Workgraph Collections repository](https://github.com/superstar54/workgraph-collections) to see demonstrations of how to utilize AiiDA Workgraph for different computational codes.

## Examples
Suppose we want to calculate ```(x + y) * z ``` in two steps. First, add `x` and `y`, then multiply the result with `z`.

```python
from aiida_workgraph import WorkGraph, task

# define add task
@task.calcfunction
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# define multiply task
@task.calcfunction
def multiply(x, y):
    return x*y

# Create a workgraph to link the tasks.
wg = WorkGraph("test_add_multiply")
wg.add_task(add, name="add1")
wg.add_task(multiply, name="multiply1")
wg.add_link(wg.tasks["add1"].outputs["result"], wg.tasks["multiply1"].inputs["x"])

```

Prepare inputs and submit the workflow:

```python
from aiida import load_profile

load_profile()

wg.submit(inputs = {"add1": {"x": 2, "y": 3}, "multiply1": {"y": 4}}, wait=True)
print("Result of multiply1 is", wg.tasks["multiply1"].outputs[0].value)
```

Start the web app, open a terminal and run:
```console
workgraph web start
```

Then visit the page http://127.0.0.1:8000/workgraph, you should find a `first_workflow` WorkGraph, click the pk and view the WorkGraph.

One can also generate the node graph from the process:
```console
verdi node generate pk
```
